A robust and user-friendly command-line (CLI) application designed for efficient management of personal and professional contacts. This system provides a streamlined, terminal-based interface for users to perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Built entirely with standard Python libraries and an integrated SQLite database, it serves as a lightweight and portable solution for contact organization without requiring external dependencies.

This project is an excellent demonstration of core software development principles, including database interaction, user input handling, and modular code structure, all within a familiar command-line environment.

-   **üìÑ View All Contacts:** Display the entire contact list in a clean, tabular format for easy readability. The system presents information clearly, making it simple to browse through all saved records at a glance.
-   **üîç Dynamic Search Functionality:** Quickly locate any contact by searching for their name. The search feature is designed to be fast and effective, helping you find the information you need without scrolling through long lists.
-   **‚úèÔ∏è Effortless Updates:** Modify existing contact information with ease. The application allows you to update a contact's phone number or email address, ensuring your records remain current.
-   **‚ùå Secure Deletion:** Safely remove contacts that are no longer needed. The system includes a confirmation step to prevent accidental data loss.
-   **üíæ Persistent SQLite Storage:** All contact information is securely stored in a local SQLite database file (`pythontut.db`). This ensures data integrity and persistence, meaning your information is saved automatically and remains available across sessions.
